** This is still a work in progress

This is an implementation of the OpenLR (Open Location Reference) protocol based on OsmSharp. Development is sponsered by via.nl (http://via.nl/) and Be-Mobile (http://www.be-mobile-international.com/). 

Decoding/encoding is possible using different datasources, OpenStreetMap, NWB and TomTom MultiNet.
